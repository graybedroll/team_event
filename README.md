Our barplot is based on the amount of times one of our team members used certain emotes over the course of 6 days. We measured by number of appearances and omitting one-off emotes. Scrolling over the bars will make them change color and increase in size. It also makes a number appear above the bar, that number of course being the number of times the emote was used.
